This project wasn't too difficult. I took the time to go through the HTML and add alt tags to the images and fix a few things in the semantics.
The css portion was interesting, I was trying to find what selectors I could consolidate and which ones I couldn't. There are a few slectors
that mess up the images and styles once they are consolidated. Overall I believe that I was able to consolidate and put them in semantic order
as best as I can.
